PrioritySearchQueue===================An implementation in F# of the priority search queue described by R. Hinze in his paper 'A Simple Implementation Technique for Priority Search Queues'.A priority search queue can serve as an associative map, mapping keys to values.	// Create queue that maps string keys to integer values (priorities)	let  psq = [("C", 2); ("A", 3); ("B", 1)] |> PrioritySearchQueue.ofSeq		// Lookup entry with the key "A"	let key, value =  psq |> PrioritySearchQueue.find "A"	// Add an entry with key "D" and value 1	let added = psq |> PrioritySearchQueue.add "D" 1		// Assign a value for entry with key "A" 	let updated = psq |> PrioritySearchQueue.add "A" 4	// Remove an entry with key "A"	let removed = psq |> PrioritySearchQueue.remove "A"The search queue also functions as a priority queue, giving constant time access to the entry in the queue with the minimum value (priority).		// Retreive the entry with the minimum value.  This will throw if the queue is empty.	let minKey, minValue =  psq |> PrioritySearchQueue.min		// Use tryMin if the queue might be empty	let minVal = 		match psq |> PrioritySearchQueue.tryMin with		| Some( minKey, minValue) -> minValue		| None -> -1	// Remove the entry with the minimum value. This will throw if the queue is empty.	let minKey, minValue, rest =  psq |> PrioritySearchQueue.removeMin	// Use tryRemoveMin if the queue might be empty	let minVal, rest = 		match psq |> PrioritySearchQueue.tryRemoveMin with		| Some(minKey, minValue, rest) -> minValue, rest		| None -> -1, PrioritySearchQueue.empty
